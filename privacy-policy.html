                <h2>Data Processing and Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local Processing:</strong> CalAIder uses Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano) to process event 
                    extraction locally on your device. This means that webpage content is analyzed on your computer, not 
                    sent to external servers for processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Event data and user preferences are stored locally in your browser 
                    using Chrome's storage API. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Google API Interaction:</strong> When you add, edit, or delete calendar events, CalAIder 
                    communicates directly with Google's Calendar API using secure OAuth 2.0 authentication. We do not 
                    store or have access to your Google account credentials.

                    guarantee its absolute security.
